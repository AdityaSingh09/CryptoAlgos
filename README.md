# CryptoAlgos
This Repo consists of all the Libraries and the codes that we used to measure the time and energy consumption of cryptographic algorithms on IoT Devices

1. Install Pycryptodome, Crypto and Cryptography Libraries from the Terminals of Raspbian OS (On Raspberry Pi) so that we can use them for encrypting files using the cryptographic algorithms.
2. Download Arduino on your PC
3. Extraxt the TroykaCurrent-master.zip to the libraries folder of the Arduino IDE
4. Connect all the necessary wires with Arduino Leonardo, ACS712 and Raspberry Pi and then connect them to your PC/Laptop
5. Run the Cryptographic Algorithms on the Raspberry Pi
6. Run the
